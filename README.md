# spotidy
Providing convenience functions to connect R with the 'Spotify' application programming interface ('API'). At first it aims to help setting up the OAuth2.0 Authentication flow. The default output of the get_*() functions is tidy, but optionally the functions could return the raw response from the 'API' as well. The search_*() and get_*() functions can be combined. See the vignette for more information and examples and the official Spotify for Developers website &lt;https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/> for information about the Web 'API'.
